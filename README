BUILDING AND INSTALLING

You will need GHC 6 (The Glorious/Glasgow Haskell Compilation System) and
GNU make to compile riot. Once you have ensured that you have these programs
installed,

 1. Edit system.mk to change some settings for your system (usually in the
    case it has broken wide character support).

 2. Run 'make' ('gmake' on some systems) to build riot.

 3. Run 'make install' to install it.


CONFIGURATION

Configuration must be done at build time by editing the Config.hs
in this directory. See ConfigAPI.hs for the settings that can be
changed.


MISCELLANEOUS NOTES

Riot stores its data in mbox format files: you may open riot files
in any mail reader, and also open normal mailboxes in riot.

The name of the program is a recursive acronym for 
'Riot is an Information/Incredible Organisation Tool' .


CREDITS

Riot itself was mostly written by me, Tuomo Valkonen. 

Stefan Wehr has written some significant improvements.

The currently dysfunctional support for dynamic loading of 
configuration with hs-plugins was written by Don Stewart.

The code in Ginsu/ and Curses/ is mostly by John Meacham; see the
LICENSE therein for details. I have made some minor modifications.
